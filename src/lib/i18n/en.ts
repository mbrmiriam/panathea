    title: "Ana Inchausti",
    description1: "Graduated in International Nursing from the University of Navarra, where I had the opportunity to complete a rotation at the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC). My training was further enriched by specializing in surgical nursing and anesthesia at the University of Navarra Clinic, a reference center for healthcare excellence.",
    description2: "For over seven years, I have dedicated my career to surgical nursing, working in both the public and private sectors, having worked with more than 30 surgical teams in more than 10 hospitals. I have had the honor of participating in international conferences, highlighting a live surgery performed in Turkey, and have acquired solid experience in managing surgical teams, handling complex cases, and caring for high-profile patients.",
    description3: "These experiences have allowed me not only to perfect my technique but also to understand the profound barriers that patients face when navigating a complex and often depersonalized healthcare system."
