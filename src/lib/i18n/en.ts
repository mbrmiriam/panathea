      text: "As first-time parents, we were exhausted and desperate. Our baby had been through several medical consultations, but no one could identify the problem. Then we turned to this service, and in less than 24 hours, we got an appointment with a leading pediatrician in Spain. Ana not only managed everything quickly but also accompanied us to the consultation, communicating to the medical team the symptoms she had also observed. Thanks to that detailed check-up, we were able to identify the problem, and within days, our daughter improved remarkably: she was calmer, sleeping better, and the symptoms disappeared. It was an indescribable relief to have her professionalism and dedication at such a critical time for our family. A service that truly makes a difference!",

      text: "When I contacted Ana, I was exhausted and knew something wasn't right. Thanks to her promptness and professionalism, she quickly organized a comprehensive assessment and detailed medical check-up at one of Spain's most cutting-edge hospitals. That's when I was diagnosed with two tumors that required very complex surgeries and impeccable coordination between specialists. Initially, my family and I were very scared; it was news that hit us hard. Ana was our support every step of the way. Moreover, she not only found the best surgeons but was also by my side every moment, before, during, and after the surgeries.",

      text: "On the day of surgery, I went to the operating room feeling calm, fully confident that I was in the best hands. Ana held my hand until I fell asleep, and during the operation, she kept my family informed and calm with constant updates. Everything went wonderfully, and today I'm here, grateful to have found Ana. She's someone who takes care of even the smallest detail and gives you the peace of mind of knowing you're in the best hands. I can never thank her enough.",
